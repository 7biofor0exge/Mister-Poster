## God Eater Burst Gameplay Tips
 
God Eater Burst is not just a hack-and-slash game. It also requires strategy, teamwork, and customization to succeed in the challenging missions. Here are some tips and tricks to help you become a better God Eater:

- Choose your weapon type wisely. Each weapon type has its own advantages and disadvantages, as well as different skills and bullet types. For example, short blades are fast and agile, but have low damage and range. Buster blades are powerful and can block attacks, but are slow and consume stamina. Long blades are balanced and can perform mid-air jumps, but have low defense. Guns can shoot various bullets, but have limited ammo and overheat. Experiment with different weapon types and find the one that suits your playstyle.
- Customize your equipment. You can upgrade your weapons and shields with materials you get from missions or exchange. You can also create your own bullets with different effects and attributes. You can also equip skills that enhance your abilities or give you new ones. For example, you can equip skills that increase your attack, defense, speed, stamina, or recovery. You can also equip skills that let you perform actions like air dash, guard cancel, or devour cancel. Try to optimize your equipment for each mission and enemy type.
- Learn the enemy patterns. Each Aragami has its own behavior, attacks, weaknesses, and breakable parts. You can check the database for information on each Aragami, or observe them in battle. Try to exploit their weak points and avoid their strong points. For example, you can aim for the tail of a Vajra to deal more damage and prevent it from using its electric attacks. You can also break parts of an Aragami to weaken it or get rare materials.
- Use your God Arc effectively. Your God Arc is not just a weapon, but also a tool. You can use it to devour enemies and enter burst mode, which gives you enhanced abilities and access to aragami bullets. You can also use it to heal yourself or your allies by devouring them. You can also use it to activate traps or switches in the field. You can also use it to communicate with your teammates by using voice commands or gestures.
- Work as a team. God Eater Burst is a cooperative game, where you can play with up to three other players online or locally. You can also play with AI-controlled teammates who have their own personalities and preferences. You can give orders to your teammates by using voice commands or gestures. You can also share your aragami bullets with them by devouring them or shooting them with link bullets. You can also revive them if they fall in battle by devouring them or using recovery items.

God Eater Burst is a fun and rewarding game that offers a lot of content and replay value. By following these tips and tricks, you can improve your skills and enjoy the game more.
