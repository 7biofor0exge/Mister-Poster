In this article, we'll show you how to use Microsoft OneNote as a portable app. A portable app is a program that can run without installation and doesn't leave any traces on the host computer. You can run a portable app from any removable storage device, such as a USB flash drive, an external hard drive, or a memory card.
 
## Step 1: Download OneNote
 
The first step is to download OneNote from the official website[^1^]. You can choose between the Windows version and the Mac version, depending on your operating system. The download is free and doesn't require a Microsoft account. However, if you want to sync your notes to OneDrive, you'll need to sign in with one.
 
## Step 2: Extract OneNote
 
The next step is to extract OneNote from the downloaded file. You can use any file compression software, such as WinRAR or 7-Zip, to do this. Simply right-click on the file and choose "Extract here" or "Extract to folder". You'll get a folder named "OneNote" that contains all the files needed to run the program.
 
## Step 3: Copy OneNote to Your Removable Device
 
The final step is to copy the OneNote folder to your removable device. You can use any device that has enough space to store your notes. For example, you can use a USB flash drive with at least 4 GB of capacity. Simply drag and drop the OneNote folder to your device and wait for the transfer to complete.
 
## Step 4: Run OneNote from Your Removable Device
 
Now you're ready to use OneNote as a portable app. To run it, simply plug your device into any computer and open the OneNote folder. Then double-click on the file named "OneNote.exe" and wait for the program to launch. You'll see a window that asks you to sign in with your Microsoft account or create one. If you don't want to sync your notes to OneDrive, you can skip this step and use OneNote offline.
 
You can now create and edit your notes as usual. You can also import and export your notes from other sources, such as Evernote or Google Keep. To do this, go to the "File" menu and choose "Import" or "Export". You can also customize your settings, such as the default notebook location, the language, and the theme.
 
## Conclusion
 
Microsoft OneNote is a powerful note-taking app that can help you organize your ideas and projects. By using it as a portable app, you can take your notes with you wherever you go and use them on any computer without installation. This way, you can enjoy the benefits of OneNote without leaving any traces on the host computer.
